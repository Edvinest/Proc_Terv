2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net processzor/PFC_inst/phasenum_reg[1]_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin processzor/PFC_inst/Instr_code_reg[5]_i_2/O, cell processzor/PFC_inst/Instr_code_reg[5]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning

Net processzor/PFC_inst/phasenum_reg[1]_1[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin processzor/PFC_inst/KK_const_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell processzor/PFC_inst/KK_const_reg[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 mem/ram_2k_generate.akv7.kcpsm6_rom has an input control pin mem/ram_2k_generate.akv7.kcpsm6_rom/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: mem/Q[6]) which is driven by a register (processzor/PFC_inst/programflowcontrol.programcounter_reg[6]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
